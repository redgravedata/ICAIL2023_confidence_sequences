This repository is the official implementation of Confidence Sequences for Evaluating One-Phase Technology-Assisted Review. [this should be a link to the ArXiv paper]

Electronic discovery (eDiscovery) relies heavily on technology-assisted review (TAR) workflows. Although many evaluation methods have been proposed, they have had little impact on eDiscovery practice. This is due, in part, to the operational constraints faced by eDiscovery reviewers and managers.

To address these challenges, we present a new evaluation approach for one-phase TAR workflows based on confidence sequences. Our approach provides review managers with complete control over the design and duration of the TAR workflow, as well as the amount and timing of review of evaluation documents.

Using our method, evaluation documents can be reused for supervised learning while preserving valid frequentist confidence intervals on recall at all points during review. Although the method is expensive in terms of sample size, it is plausible for large-scale reviews and has many opportunities for improvement.

We believe that our approach will be valuable to researchers and practitioners interested in evaluating the effectiveness of one-phase TAR workflows in the context of eDiscovery.
